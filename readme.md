Fetch - Where the pets come out to play.

A social networking application for famous pets to meet and talk about famous pets things.

Technologies used for Fetch were few.  I installed the devise gem to be able to generate user authentication code. The app itself is written in rails with html and css to help design. It was deployed through Heroku.

I would say that Fetch approached me - I didn't necessarily seek out Fetch. It came about from a muddled mind of different ideas, with a common theme of having a database of animals that needed companionship.  There are still some unsolved problems, which include:

1) When a new profile is created for a famous pet (for the animals database), the data doesn't always make it through. The animal ID is created, but no data to show for it.

2) Was trying to figure out how to redirect to create a profile after a user "signs up" (rather than logging in), but did not dedicate the time to fully seeing this through.
